		<h3>Installation</h3>
		<p>Follow standard plugin installation procedure.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h3>Default configuration</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Logger plugin has been designed to work out of the box in both Advanced and Basic versions. In its default configuration, it logs all messages to <strong>LoggerSysLog</strong> table in the same database used by your instance of Vanilla Forums. Such table is created the first time a message is logged.
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					The default Log Level is <strong>INFO</strong>. This means that log messages with a lower level will be ignored. To change it, use the User Interface (Advanced Logger), or modify the <strong>config.xml</strong> file by adding the line <code>&lt;level value="{new_log_level}" /&gt;</code> in the <code>&lt;root&gt;</code> node, replacing <strong>{new_log_level}</strong> with your desired Log Level.
				</p>
				<p>
					To view the allowed values of the Log Level, please visit <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4php/docs/configuration.html" title="Log4php - Configuration">Log4php website</a>.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Configuration</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>Advanced Version</h4>
				<p>
					Advanced Logger for Vanilla offers a convenient User Interface to configure the various settings for the Plugin. To access it, simply open Vanilla Administration page and click on <i>Plugins -> Logger</i>.<br />
					The interface has been designed to be very intuitive, and all its parts are thoroughly documented.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the best features of the Advanced Version over the Basic is the ability of sending log messages to remote Log Servers, such as <a href="http://papertrailapp.com" title="PaperTrail" target="_blank">Papertrail</a>, <a href="http://loggly.com" title="Loggly" target="_blank">Loggly</a> or even a Remote SysLog server.<br />
					This allows to centralize all the logs, removing the need to fetch files from each website and saving a significant amount of time. This feature alone is invaluable for any Administrator who manages several communities.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Basic Version</h4>
				<p>
					Basic Version provides a reduced set of features, and doesn't come with a User Interface for the configuration.<br />
					If you wish to change the configuration, you have to modify file <strong>config.xml</strong>, which can be found in Plugin's directory. Information on how to write a configuration file can be found on <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4php/docs/configuration.html" title="Log4php - Configuration">Log4php website</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Important</strong><br />
					Basic Version only supports the appenders provided by standard Log4php, plus an additional one to write log messages to a table in Vanilla database.
				</p>
